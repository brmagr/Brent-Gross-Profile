<p class="mainhp">Hello, please allow me to tell you a little about myself. I have been interested in computers since the first time I heard about computers. My most recent passion has been Web Development. It amazes me when I see how code works. With my knowledge, I want to be the developer that impresses you each and every time.  I have been interested in web design since I first saw what code can do. It has always amazed me how you take practically nothing and make it into something amazing. My main goal is to design a site or an app that no one has ever seen.</p>

<p class="secondhp">My family is behind me while I pursue my education and whatever else I may pursue in the future.  I want to show my family that I can do whatever I put my mind to.  In the last couple of years, my son has peaked interest in web development.  I hope that in some way that I encouraged him.  Mainly, I hope I encourage him not to give up.</p>
